# stupid_gifs
A gif player, written in Rust using the [pixels crate](https://docs.rs/pixels/latest/pixels/). 

Simply runs a gif as fluidly as possible without dropping frames, even at the minimum frame time (1/100 second).

You can run the latest file in the [releases](https://github.com/G2-Games/stupid_gifs/releases) section, or build it.

## Running:
Just run `cargo build --release` in the repo after cloning, and you'll get a file selection window. Choose a gif, and it should play!

## Keybinds: 
```
Space:      Pause
P:          Hide/Show progress bar
Left/Right: Skip 5 seconds
Scroll:     Scrub through frames
Escape:     Kill the program
```
